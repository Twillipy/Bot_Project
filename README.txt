Bot Project v4

About:
  A generational evolution simulation controlled by feedforward neural networks.

Description:
  Each 'bot' has its actions controlled by a feedforward neural network.
  Bots travel through the world in search of pellets to provide energy.
  A new generation is spawned when sufficiently low bot numbers are reached.

Platform:
  Windows
